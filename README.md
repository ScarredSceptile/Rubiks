# Rubiks

This is a private project I made just to test myself a bit.

Bugs and problems:
  - Some of the blocks are spawned in the wrong order causing it to be difficult to solve with 4x4x4 cubes or higher.
  - There is no way to spin all sides on cubes that are 4x4x4 or larger. Have not implemented a way to just drag the mouse to turn the cube.
  
Things I want to add:
  - Compatability with phones
